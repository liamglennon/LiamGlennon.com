<h1>Electroplating 3D Prints</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project explores the fabrication of custom parabolic reflectors using 3D printing and copper electroplating. It combines the speed of additive manufacturing with precision metal finishing, offering a versatile pathway for rapid prototyping.</p>
    <p>Each step, from CAD design to final assembly, was optimized to ensure structural integrity and high-quality RF performance. This blend of digital design and hands-on engineering showcases the potential of hybrid fabrication techniques.</p>

    <h2>CAD Design</h2>
    <p>The reflector was meticulously designed using CAD tools to replicate the contours of automotive headlight reflectors. Focused on achieving optimal directivity and feed alignment, the design balanced compactness with performance.</p>
    <p>Exported STL files preserved intricate design details, ensuring printability and dimensional accuracy crucial for subsequent stages.</p>

    <h2>3D Printing</h2>
    <p>The reflector was 3D printed using FDM technology with a 0.4 mm nozzle and 0.2 mm layer height. PLA filament was selected for its reliability and ease of post-processing, ensuring stable geometries and smooth surfaces.</p>
    <p>Print orientation was carefully optimized to reduce visible layer lines, enhancing both aesthetic and functional qualities of the reflective surface.</p>

    <h2>Post-Processing</h2>
    <p>The printed parts underwent thorough sanding with fine-grit paper to remove surface irregularities, followed by cleaning with isopropyl alcohol to eliminate debris and oils. A degreasing bath ensured an ultra-clean surface for the next step.</p>
    <p>Post-processing is critical to achieving a smooth, conductive surface, essential for high-quality electroplating and optimal RF performance.</p>

    <h2>Conductive Coating and Electroplating</h2>
    <p>A carbon-based conductive spray was evenly applied to the sanded surface, establishing an initial conductive path for copper electroplating. The plated layer, deposited in a CuSO₄ bath with sulfuric acid and chloride ions, achieved a thickness of 20–25 μm.</p>
    <p>The reflector was mounted on a rotating jig to ensure uniform coverage. After plating, the part was rinsed and dried, resulting in a highly conductive, professional-grade surface ready for RF testing.</p>
