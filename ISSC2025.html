<h1>My ISSC 2025 Presentation</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Presented at ISSC 2025</h2>
    <p>In June 2025, I had the honour of presenting my research paper at the <span class="highlight">36th Irish Signals and Systems Conference (ISSC 2025)</span>. This experience marked a significant milestone in my academic journey, as I presented as a <strong>lead author and final-year undergraduate</strong> from Maynooth University.</p>
    <p>The conference was held at Atlantic Technological University, Letterkenny, and provided an invaluable opportunity to share my work alongside senior researchers, industry professionals, and fellow students from across Ireland and beyond.</p>

    <h2>About the Paper</h2>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Performance Evaluation of a Metal-Coated Headlamp Reflector Antenna for V2X Applications</p>
    <p>The paper introduced a novel, low-cost approach to integrating antennas into vehicle headlamp assemblies using <strong>3D printing and copper electroplating</strong>. This project showcased the potential of combining additive manufacturing with RF design to develop innovative antenna solutions for modern V2X communication systems.</p>
    <p>Presenting this research as a lead undergraduate author was a humbling and rewarding experience. It demonstrated that student-led engineering projects can make meaningful contributions to the field of wireless communication technology.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting on the Experience</h2>
    <p>Attending ISSC 2025 was a valuable learning experience. It not only allowed me to share my work with a wider audience but also offered insights into ongoing research in the field. The opportunity to engage with experienced researchers and engineers was both inspiring and educational.</p>
    <p>As a final-year undergraduate, presenting at a national conference reinforced my belief in the importance of curiosity, perseverance, and collaboration in research. I am grateful for the support of my supervisors, peers, and the ISSC community for making this experience possible.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">Thank you to everyone who attended and contributed!</p>
